            <p>I'm a proud Nashville native, who's been so lucky to have had amazing opportunities to learn, live, and teach in some amazing places. Attending Belmont University, I studied abroad in both Greece and London. After graduation, I earned a teaching certificate and was hired by the Japanese government to teach English to primary and high school students in rural Japan. 
            <br><br>
            I found my wife while in Japan, and we moved back to Nashville so I could help father, a homebuilder, capitalize on the booming housing market. I gained my builder's license and my real estate license in the years after. I earned a postgraduate certificate in international construction management from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom via distance learning. <br><br>
            Currently, I am retraining to become a web developer as a member of the first cohort of Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
